This is my very first very project I made after the course of introduction to programming on dec 2022. The project is a hockey quiz where the user can select whether he wants to play the game in English or in Finnish and then decice how many questions about hockey will be asked. The application has basic error handling for wrong inputs and it won't crash down. This project strenghtened my skills on Python.

I won't update this project anymore as I think console based quiz is very unefficient for publishing and boring for the users. I'm planning on doing this project in much larger scale as full stack application using React and Node.js later when I have time.
